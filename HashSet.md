## HashSet in Java

A HashSet in Java is a collection that stores unique elements. It's based on the concept of a hash table, which uses a hashing function to efficiently store and retrieve elements.

Key Characteristics:

Unordered: Elements are not stored in any specific order.
Unique: Duplicate elements are not allowed.
Efficient: Uses hashing for fast insertion, deletion, and retrieval.
Null elements: Can store a single null element.
Implementation:

HashSet is implemented using a HashMap internally. Each element in the HashSet is a key in the HashMap, and the value associated with each key is a dummy object.

Common Operations:

add(element): Adds an element to the HashSet.
remove(element): Removes an element from the HashSet.
contains(element): Checks if an element exists in the HashSet.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the HashSet.
isEmpty(): Checks if the HashSet is empty.
clear(): Removes all elements from the HashSet.
iterator(): Returns an iterator to iterate over the elements.

Use Cases:

Storing unique elements without any specific order.
Implementing sets in algorithms and data structures.
Removing duplicates from a collection.
Checking for the presence of an element efficiently.
In Summary:

HashSet is a powerful tool for working with unique elements in Java. Its efficient implementation and simple usage make it a valuable addition to any Java developer's toolkit.
