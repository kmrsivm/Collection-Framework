## TreeSet in Java

### A TreeSet in Java is a sorted collection of unique elements. It's implemented using a self-balancing binary search tree, typically a Red-Black tree. This underlying data structure ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, even for large datasets.   

Key Characteristics:

	•	Sorted: Elements are stored in ascending order based on their natural ordering or a custom comparator.
	•	Unique: Duplicate elements are not allowed.
	•	Efficient: Operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval have a time complexity of O(log n).
 

 Common Operations:

	1.	add(element): Adds an element to the TreeSet.
	2.	remove(element): Removes an element from the TreeSet.
	3.	contains(element): Checks if an element exists in the TreeSet.
	4.	size(): Returns the number of elements in the TreeSet.
	5.	isEmpty(): Checks if the TreeSet is empty.
	6.	clear(): Removes all elements from the TreeSet.
	7.	first(): Returns the first (smallest) element.
	8.	last(): Returns the last (largest) element.
	9.	headSet(element): Returns a subset of elements less than the specified element.
	10.	tailSet(element): Returns a subset of elements greater than or equal to the specified element.
	11.	subSet(fromElement, toElement): Returns a subset of elements within a specific range.
Use Cases:

	1.	Storing and retrieving elements in sorted order:
	•	Example: Maintaining a list of students ranked by scores.
	2.	Implementing priority queues:
	•	Example: Scheduling tasks based on deadlines.
	3.	Maintaining unique elements in a sorted collection:
	•	Example: Storing unique timestamps in ascending order.


In Summary:

	•	TreeSet is a valuable tool for working with sorted and unique elements in Java.
	•	Its efficient implementation and versatile operations make it a powerful choice for solving problems involving data structures and algorithms.
