## TreeSet in Java

### A TreeSet in Java is a sorted collection of unique elements. It's implemented using a self-balancing binary search tree, typically a Red-Black tree. This underlying data structure ensures efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval operations, even for large datasets.   

Key Characteristics:

Sorted: Elements are stored in ascending order based on their natural ordering or a custom comparator.   
Unique: Duplicate elements are not allowed.
Efficient: Operations like insertion, deletion, and retrieval have a time complexity of O(log n).
Common Operations:

add(element): Adds an element to the TreeSet.
remove(element): Removes an element from the TreeSet.
contains(element): Checks if an element exists in the TreeSet.
size(): Returns the number of elements in the TreeSet.
isEmpty(): Checks if the TreeSet is empty.
clear(): Removes all elements from the TreeSet.
first(): Returns the first (smallest) element.   
last(): Returns the last (largest) element.   
headSet(element): Returns a subset of elements less than the specified element.
tailSet(element): Returns a subset of elements greater than or equal to the specified element.
subSet(fromElement, toElement): Returns a subset of elements within a specific range.

Use Cases:

Storing and retrieving elements in sorted order.
Implementing priority queues.
Maintaining unique elements in a sorted collection.
In Summary:

TreeSet is a valuable tool for working with sorted and unique elements in Java. Its efficient implementation and versatile operations make it a powerful choice for various data structures and algorithms.
